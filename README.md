## This application will ultimately be a SAST application that allows for people to run locally and attempt to find bugs, vulnerabilities, and secrets. This will hopefully be used by the bug bounty community and make it more accessible to audit source code.

### If you decide to use this, please feel free to also fork and submit PR's for detection as well as refactoring, thanks :)
